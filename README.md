React Interview Questions


React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces. In a React interview, the interviewer may ask about your experience with React, including topics such as components, JSX, state and props, hooks, and performance optimization. They may also ask about related technologies such as Redux and React Router. The interviewer may also ask about your problem-solving and debugging skills, as well as your experience with other JavaScript libraries and frameworks. Additionally, you may be asked about your experience with front-end development in general, such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

React is a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It was developed by Facebook, and is often used for building single-page applications and mobile applications.

React allows you to build reusable UI components, and makes it easy to manage the state of your application. It uses a virtual DOM (Document Object Model) to improve performance by limiting the number of DOM manipulation operations required to update the view.

To get started with React, you'll need to have a basic understanding of JavaScript. If you're new to JavaScript, you may want to start by learning the fundamentals before diving into React.

Here's a brief overview of how to use React:

Install React:
To use React, you'll need to include the React library in your project. You can do this by adding the following script tag to your HTML file:

  Code Syntax / Example

            <script src="https://unpkg.com/react@16/umd/react.development.js"></script>
            <script src="https://unpkg.com/react-dom@16/umd/react-dom.development.js"></script>
            
Alternatively, you can use a package manager like npm or yarn to install React as a dependency in your project.

Create a React component:
A React component is a piece of code that represents a part of a UI. You can create a React component by defining a JavaScript function that returns a React element. For example:

  Code Syntax / Example

      function Welcome(props) {
        return <h1>Hello, {props.name}</h1>;
      }

Render a React component:
To render a React component, you'll need to use the ReactDOM.render() method. This method takes two arguments: the React component to render, and the DOM element to render it to. For example:

   Code Syntax / Example

            ReactDOM.render(
              <Welcome name="World" />,
              document.getElementById('root')
            );   
            
This will render the Welcome component to the element with the ID root.

Use state and props:
In React, you can use props (short for "properties") to pass data from a parent component to a child component. state is similar to props, but it is private to the component and can be modified by the component itself. You can use state and props to control the data and behavior of your components.

For example, you might define a Clock component with a time state:

Code Syntax / Example


                  class Clock extends React.Component {
                    constructor(props) {
                      super(props);
                      this.state = {time: new Date()};
                    }

                    render() {
                      return <div>The time is {this.state.time.toLocaleTimeString()}.</div>;
                    }
                  }
            
            
Then, you can render the Clock component and pass it a timezone prop:

 Code Syntax / Example


                  ReactDOM.render(
                    <Clock timezone="EST" />,
                    document.getElementById('root')
                  );
            
This is just a brief introduction to React. There's much more you can do with it, such as handling events, creating forms, and integrating with APIs. If you want to learn more about React, you can check out the documentation at https://reactjs.org/.



1. What is jsx
JSX (JavaScript Syntax Extension) is a syntax extension for JavaScript that allows you to write HTML-like elements in your JavaScript code. It is used primarily with React, but can be used with other libraries and frameworks as well.

JSX allows you to write elements and components in a way that looks similar to HTML, but with the full power of JavaScript behind it. For example, you can use JSX to create a simple button element like this:

Code Syntax / Example

      <button>Click me</button>

JSX elements can also be used to create custom components, which can be reused throughout your application. For example, you can create a custom "Hello" component like this:

Code Syntax / Example
      
      const Hello = (props) => <div>Hello, {props.name}</div>

It's important to note that, while JSX looks like HTML, it is actually a different syntax that gets transpiled (converted) to JavaScript by a tool called Babel. When the code is transpiled, JSX elements are transformed into JavaScript function calls, which can be interpreted by the browser.

JSX provides a way to create React components using a syntax that is more familiar to web developers, and it also allows for better code readability, making it easier for developers to understand the structure of the application.


2. What is reconsolidation in react?

Reconciliation is the process that React uses to update the virtual DOM (Document Object Model) and determine the changes that need to be made to the actual DOM.

When a component's state or props change, React will start the reconciliation process by comparing the virtual DOM with the new virtual DOM that would be generated with the updated state or props. React will then identify the minimal set of changes that need to be made to the actual DOM to bring it in line with the new virtual DOM.

React uses a technique called "reconciliation" to update the DOM efficiently. It compares the previous virtual DOM (previous state) with the new virtual DOM (new state), and figures out which elements have changed. It will then updates the DOM with only the minimum number of changes required. This process is called "reconciliation" and it is the core concept of React.

React uses a technique called "reconciliation" to update the DOM efficiently. It compares the previous virtual DOM (previous state) with the new virtual DOM (new state), and figures out which elements have changed. It will then updates the DOM with only the minimum number of changes required. This process is called "reconciliation" and it is the core concept of React.

React's reconciliation algorithm is called "diffing" algorithm, it compares the previous and the new virtual DOM and figures out the minimum number of changes required to update the actual DOM. This process is efficient and fast, which makes React a great choice for building dynamic user interfaces.


3. What is React Routing?

React Router is a library that allows you to handle client-side routing in a React application. It helps to manage the different URLs of your application and renders the appropriate components based on the current URL.

React Router provides a set of components that you can use to define the different routes of your application. The most commonly used components are:

      <Route>: This component is used to define a specific route and the component that should be rendered when the route is active.
      <Link>: This component is used to create links that navigate to different routes within your application.
      <Switch>: This component is used to group multiple <Route> components together and only render the first one that matches the current URL.
To use React Router in your application, you need to install it by running npm install react-router-dom and then import it into your application.

Here is an example of how to use React Router to handle routing in a React application:

  Code Syntax / Example
  
      import { BrowserRouter, Route, Switch, Link } from 'react-router-dom';

      function App() {
        return (
          <BrowserRouter>
            <nav>
              <Link to="/">Home</Link>
              <Link to="/about">About</Link>
            </nav>

            <Switch>
              <Route exact path="/" component={Home} />
              <Route path="/about" component={About} />
              <Route path="*" component={NotFound} />
            </Switch>
          </BrowserRouter>
        );
      }

In this example, we are using the <BrowserRouter> component to wrap the entire application, which allows React Router to handle the client-side routing. We also have two links, one that navigates to the home page and the other one to the about page. The <Switch> component groups together the different routes and the <Route> component specifies which component to render when the route is active.


4. What is react fiber?

React Fiber is a new reconciliation algorithm that was introduced in React 16. It is a complete rewrite of the previous algorithm and aims to improve the performance and flexibility of React.

One of the main improvements of React Fiber is that it uses a new concept called "time slicing". This means that React will split the work of reconciling the virtual DOM into small chunks and spread them out over multiple frames, rather than doing all the work in one go. This allows React to more efficiently use the available browser resources and improve the overall responsiveness of the application.

React Fiber also introduces a new concept called "priority levels", which allows React to assign different priorities to different updates. This means that React can prioritize updates that are more critical to the user experience and delay less important updates.

Other benefits of React Fiber include:

Improved support for animation and layout
Better handling of errors
Improved support for asynchronous rendering
Better support for progressive loading
React Fiber also allows for more advanced features like "suspense" and "concurrent mode", which help to improve the performance of web application by loading data lazily and allowing the UI to be rendered before all the data is available.

In summary, React Fiber is a significant update to React's reconciliation algorithm that provides better performance, flexibility, and support for advanced features.


5. What are synthetic events?
In React, synthetic events are a way of handling events (such as clicks, hover, key presses, etc.) in a consistent and cross-browser compatible manner.

When an event occurs in the browser, React wraps the native event object with a synthetic event object. This synthetic event object provides a consistent interface for handling events across all browsers. This means that the same event handling code will work the same way in all browsers, without the need for additional browser-specific code.

Synthetic events have some benefits over native events:

Consistent event handling across all browsers
Improved performance by pooling event objects
Better support for handling events on the server side
Synthetic events also provide additional functionality such as the ability to access the target component, event properties, and the ability to stop event propagation.

Here is an example of how to handle a click event using a synthetic event in React:

  Code Syntax / Example

      function MyButton({ onClick }) {
        return <button onClick={onClick}>Click me</button>;
      }

      function App() {
        function handleClick(event) {
          console.log(event.target);  // The target element that was clicked
          event.preventDefault();    // Prevent the default behavior of the event
        }

        return <MyButton onClick={handleClick} />;
      }
 
In this example, the handleClick function is passed as a prop to the MyButton component. When the button is clicked, React will call the handleClick function and pass it a synthetic event object. The function can then access the event properties and methods, such as event.target and event.preventDefault().


6. What are the advantages and disadvantages of React
Advantages of React:

Reusable Components: React allows you to create reusable components that can be easily reused throughout your application. This helps to keep your code organized and makes it easier to maintain.

Virtual DOM: React uses a virtual DOM, which optimizes the performance of updates by only updating the parts of the actual DOM that have changed.

One-way Data Flow: React follows a one-way data flow, which makes it easy to understand and predict how a component will behave.

Strong Community: React has a large and active community, which means that there are many resources and libraries available to help you develop your application.

Performance: React is highly performant, thanks to the virtual DOM and other optimizations.

Disadvantages of React:

Steep Learning Curve: React has a steep learning curve, especially for developers who are new to web development or those who are not familiar with the concepts of JSX and virtual DOM.

Complexity: React is a complex library and it can take some time to understand all the concepts and features.

JSX: React uses JSX, a syntax extension for JavaScript, which can be difficult for developers to learn and understand.

Large Bundle Size: React applications can have a large bundle size, which can impact the performance of the application, especially on slower devices or low-bandwidth connections.

Large ecosystem: React has a large and expanding ecosystem, which may cause difficulty to choose the right libraries or tools.

In summary, React is a powerful and flexible library for building web applications, but it has a steep learning curve and can be complex to understand. Its advantages include reusable components, virtual DOM, and one-way data flow. Its disadvantages include a steep learning curve, complexity and large bundle size.


7. What is Jest
Jest is a popular testing framework for JavaScript, and it can be used to test React applications. Jest is commonly used with React because it is built and maintained by Facebook, the same company that maintains React.

Jest provides a variety of features that make it well-suited for testing React applications, such as:

Snapshot testing: Jest allows you to take a snapshot of a component's rendered output, and then compare it to the snapshot in future tests to ensure that the component hasn't changed.
Automatic mocking: Jest automatically mocks the modules that you import in your tests, which makes it easy to test components in isolation.
Support for async tests: Jest provides built-in support for testing asynchronous code, which makes it easy to test React components that use lifecycle methods or other async features.
Here is an example of how to use Jest to test a simple React component:

  Code Syntax / Example

      import React from 'react';
      import { render, fireEvent } from '@testing-library/react';
      import MyButton from './MyButton';

      test('MyButton component', () => {
        const { getByText } = render(<MyButton />);
        const button = getByText('Click me');
        fireEvent.click(button);
        expect(button).toHaveTextContent('Clicked!');
      });

In this example, we are importing the MyButton component and the render and fireEvent functions from the @testing-library/react library. We use the render function to render the component, and the fireEvent.click function to simulate a click event on the button.

With Jest and the testing-library/react, it is easy to test React components, and you can test different scenarios, like click events,


8. How do we test the react application?
As a React developer, there are several ways to test your React components and applications:

Unit testing: Unit testing is the practice of testing individual components or small units of code in isolation. Jest is a popular testing framework for unit testing React components. With Jest, you can write tests for individual components, and test their behavior and state changes.

Snapshot testing: Jest also provides snapshot testing, which allows you to take a snapshot of a component's rendered output and compare it to the snapshot in future tests. This is useful for ensuring that a component's output remains consistent over time.

Integration testing: Integration testing is the practice of testing how different components and modules of your application interact with each other. You can use Jest and other testing frameworks such as Enzyme to test how different components interact and how they are rendered.

End-to-end testing: End-to-end testing is the practice of testing the complete flow of your application, from the user's perspective. You can use tools such as Cypress or Selenium to test how your application behaves in a real browser.

Performance testing: Performance testing is the practice of testing the performance of your application under different loads and conditions. You can use tools such as Lighthouse or SpeedCurve to test the performance of your application and identify performance bottlenecks.

It's important to note that, testing should be an ongoing process throughout the development cycle, not just at the end. Test-driven development (TDD) can be a good practice, it means that you write your tests before writing the code, which can help you to catch bugs early on and ensure that your code is working as expected.


9. How to handle async call in react 
There are several ways to handle async calls in React, depending on the use case and complexity of the application:

Using the async and await keywords: These keywords can be used to handle async calls in a way that makes the code look and behave like synchronous code. For example, you can use await to pause the execution of a function until a promise is resolved, and then use the resolved value in the rest of the function.

  Code Syntax / Example

      async function fetchData() {
        const response = await fetch('https://my-api.com/data');
        const data = await response.json();
        return data;
      }

Using Promise: You can also use Promise directly to handle async calls. This can be useful if you need more fine-grained control over the async flow or if you need to handle multiple async calls in parallel.

  Code Syntax / Example

      fetch('https://my-api.com/data')
        .then(response => response.json())
        .then(data => console.log(data))
        .catch(error => console.error(error));

Using a state management library like Redux: If your application is complex and you have multiple async calls, state management libraries like Redux can be a good choice. In this case, you can handle async calls in your action creators, and then update the state of your application with the resolved value.


10. What is redux in react
Redux is a JavaScript library that is often used in combination with React to manage the state of a web application. It is based on the principles of Flux, an architecture for building web applications.

The main idea behind Redux is that the entire state of the application is stored in a single, centralized store. This store is an object that contains all the data that the application needs to function. Components in the application can dispatch actions to the store, which describe a change that should be made to the state. The store then updates its state based on the action and notifies the components that the state has changed.

Redux provides a few key features that make it useful for managing the state of a React application:

Predictability: Because the entire state of the application is stored in a single store, it is easy to understand the current state of the application and how it got there.
Immutability: Redux enforces immutability, which means that the state cannot be directly modified. Instead, new state must be created based on the current state. This makes it easier to track changes and debug issues.
Middleware: Redux allows you to add middleware that can intercept and modify actions before they reach the store. This allows you to add functionality such as logging, analytics, and async support.
Devtools: Redux provides a browser extension called the "Redux DevTools" that allows you to inspect the state of your application and see how it changes over time.
Redux can be a useful tool for managing the state of a React application, especially if the application is complex and has a lot of different components that need to share data. However, it's not always necessary, for small or simple apps, the use of state and context might be enough.


11. What is Flex 
Flex is a layout technique in CSS that allows you to create flexible and responsive layouts. It is part of the Flexible Box Layout module and it provides a way to align and distribute space among items within a container, even when their size is unknown or dynamic. Flexbox layout is direction-agnostic as opposed to the regular layouts (block which is vertically-based and inline which is horizontally-based).

The main components of flex layout are:

The container (display: flex): This is the parent element that holds all the flex items. By setting the display property to flex, you are telling the browser that the children of this element should be laid out using flexbox.
The flex items: These are the child elements within the container that are laid out using flexbox.
The main axis and cross axis: The main axis is the primary direction in which the flex items are laid out. The cross axis is the direction perpendicular to the main axis. By default, the main axis is horizontal and the cross axis is vertical, but you can change this using the flex-direction property.
Flex layout provides several properties that allow you to control the alignment, distribution, and size of flex items. Some of the most commonly used properties are:

justify-content: controls the alignment of flex items along the main axis.
align-items: controls the alignment of flex items along the cross axis.
flex-wrap: controls whether or not flex items will wrap to the next line when there is not enough space on the current line.
flex-direction: controls the direction of the main axis.
Flexbox is a powerful tool that allows you to create complex layouts with minimal code, it is compatible with most of the modern browser and it is widely used in web development.


12. React localization
React localization, also known as internationalization (i18n), is the process of making a React application available in multiple languages or locales. It allows the application to adapt to different cultures and regions, providing a better user experience for global audiences.

There are several ways to implement localization in a React application:

Using a library: There are several libraries available that provide localization functionality for React. Some popular choices are react-intl, react-i18next, and react-localize-redux. These libraries provide an easy way to handle translations, number and date formatting, and other localization-related tasks.

Using Context: React's context API can be used to manage the application's current locale and provide it to the components that need it. This can be done by creating a context object and a provider component, and then consuming the context in the components that need it.

Using props: Another way to pass the current locale to the components that need it is by passing it as a prop from the parent component.

Using state: you can use the state to manage the current locale and pass it to the components that need it.

Once you have the current locale in your components, you can use it to format strings, dates, and numbers, and to look up translations.

It is important to note that, localization should be an ongoing process throughout the development cycle, not just at the end, it should be tested with the different languages and locales, also it's important to have a good way to manage translations, such as using a translation management system (TMS) or a spreadsheet.


13. Which tool is used to develop react
There are several tools that can be used to develop React applications, some of the most popular ones are:

Create React App (CRA): This is a tool developed by Facebook that allows you to quickly set up a new React project with a basic file structure and a development server. It also includes a build tool that can be used to create a production-ready version of the application.

Next.js: This is a framework built on top of React that allows you to build server-rendered React applications. It provides a development server, automatic code splitting, and server-side rendering out of the box.

Gatsby: This is a static site generator for React that allows you to build fast, performant websites using modern technologies such as GraphQL and Webpack.

React Native: This is a framework that allows you to build mobile applications for iOS and Android using React.

CodeSandbox: This is an online code editor that allows you to easily create, share, and collaborate on React projects.

Webpack: This is a module bundler that can be used to build React applications. It allows you to use a variety of different tools and plugins to optimize your application for production.

Babel: This is a JavaScript compiler that can be used to convert modern JavaScript code (including JSX, the syntax used by React) into code that can be run in older browsers.

These are just a few examples of the tools that can be used to develop React applications. The best tool for your project will depend on your specific needs and requirements.


14. What is the primary distinction between javascript and typescript? 

JavaScript and TypeScript are both programming languages, but there are some key differences between them:

TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript, which means that any valid JavaScript code is also valid TypeScript code. However, TypeScript includes additional features such as static typing, classes, and interfaces.

TypeScript has a stronger emphasis on type safety. In JavaScript, variables can change types dynamically, whereas in TypeScript, variables are defined with a specific type, and the compiler will catch type errors before the code runs.

TypeScript has better support for object-oriented programming, with features such as classes, interfaces, and access modifiers.

TypeScript has better support for large-scale projects, with features such as namespaces and modules, which can help to organize and maintain code.

TypeScript is a more recent language and has more active development and support.

JavaScript is more widely used and supported by many existing libraries and frameworks.

In summary, TypeScript provides more structure and type safety, while JavaScript is more flexible and widely supported.


15. What are the events in react
In React, events are used to handle user interactions with the application, such as clicks, form submissions, and key presses. React provides a way to handle events using a syntax that is similar to handling events in HTML. Some examples of events in React are:

onClick: This event is triggered when a user clicks on an element.

  Code Syntax / Example
      
      <button onClick={handleClick}>Click me</button>

onChange: This event is triggered when a user changes the value of an input field.

  Code Syntax / Example

      <input onChange={handleChange}/>

onSubmit: This event is triggered when a user submits a form.

  Code Syntax / Example

      <form onSubmit={handleSubmit}>

onKeyPress: This event is triggered when a user presses a key on the keyboard.

  Code Syntax / Example

      <input onKeyPress={handleKeyPress}/>

onMouseEnter: This event is triggered when a user moves the mouse pointer over an element.

  Code Syntax / Example

      <div onMouseEnter={handleMouseEnter}>

onMouseLeave: This event is triggered when a user moves the mouse pointer away from an element.

  Code Syntax / Example

      <div onMouseLeave={handleMouseLeave}>

In React, event handlers are functions that are called when an event is triggered. These functions can be defined in the component's class or using arrow function inside the JSX element


16. how to make ajax call in react, how can we do 
There are several ways to make an AJAX call in a React application. Here are a couple of popular approaches:

Using the Fetch API: The Fetch API is a built-in JavaScript API that can be used to make network requests. It can be used to make an AJAX call in a React application like this:

  Code Syntax / Example

      fetch('https://example.com/data')
          .then(response => response.json())
          .then(data => {
              // handle data
          })
          .catch(error => {
              // handle error
          });

Using a library: There are several libraries available that provide a more powerful and flexible way to make AJAX calls in a React application. Some popular choices are axios, superagent, and isomorphic-fetch. These libraries provide an easy way to handle responses, errors, and other details of the AJAX call. For example, using axios:

  Code Syntax / Example
 
     import axios from 'axios';

      axios.get('https://example.com/data')
        .then(response => {
          console.log(response.data);
        })
        .catch(error => {
          console.log(error);
        });

It's important to note that, when making an AJAX call, you should always handle the response and errors properly and also, when you are using a library, you should consider the size of the library, that is important for the performance of your application.

Another important aspect to consider is, when to make the ajax call. You should avoid making the call on the render method, as this could lead to unnecessary calls


17. What is bootstrap, how many ways in react, What is the advantages of bootstrap
Bootstrap is a popular front-end development framework that provides a set of pre-designed CSS and JavaScript components that can be easily used to create responsive, mobile-first web pages.

There are several ways to use Bootstrap in a React application:

CSS only: You can include the Bootstrap CSS file in your application and use the classes provided by Bootstrap to style your components. This approach is simple and easy to implement, but it may not be as flexible as using the JavaScript components.

JavaScript Components: You can include the Bootstrap JavaScript files and use the components provided by Bootstrap, such as modals, carousels, and tooltips. This approach allows you to use the full functionality provided by Bootstrap, but it may require more setup and configuration.

React Bootstrap: This is a set of React components that wrap the Bootstrap JavaScript components and provide a more React-like API. This approach allows you to use the Bootstrap functionality in your application while still writing your components in React.

Bootstrap-React: This is a library that provides Bootstrap as a set of React components, which can be easily integrated into a React application.

The advantages of using Bootstrap in a React application are:

Responsive design: Bootstrap provides a responsive grid system that allows your application to adapt to different screen sizes, making it accessible on a wide range of devices.

Consistency: Bootstrap provides a consistent look and feel across all browsers and platforms, making it easy to create a professional-looking application.

Pre-designed components: Bootstrap provides a wide range of pre-designed components


18. What are the style component
In React, a style component is a component that is used to apply styles to other components. There are several ways to create style components in React, but the most common approach is to use a library such as styled-components.

styled-components is a library that allows you to write actual CSS code to style your components, and it generates unique class names for the styles, which helps to avoid class name conflicts. It also allows you to pass props to the components, which makes it easy to customize the styles based on the component's state or other parameters.

Here's an example of how to use styled-components to create a style component:

  Code Syntax / Example
  
      import styled from 'styled-components'

      const StyledButton = styled.button`
        background-color: #4CAF50;
        color: white;
        padding: 15px 32px;
        text-align: center;
        text-decoration: none;
        display: inline-block;
        font-size: 16px;
      `

You can then use this component to create a button that will have the specified styles:

  Code Syntax / Example

      <StyledButton>Click me!</StyledButton>

Another popular library for styling in React is emotion, it works similarly as styled-components, but it has a slightly different syntax for creating the css.

Styling in React can be a complex topic, but using style components allows you to write modular, maintainable styles that are tightly integrated with your components, making it easier to understand and manage the styles in your application.


19. What are the new things in html5, What are the advantages of html5
HTML5 is the latest version of the Hypertext Markup Language (HTML), which is used to create and structure the content of web pages. Some of the new features and improvements that were introduced in HTML5 include:

New semantic elements: HTML5 introduces several new semantic elements, such as <header>, <nav>, <article>, <section>, <aside>, <figure>, and <figcaption>, which make it easier to structure and organize the content of a web page.

Audio and Video: HTML5 includes support for native audio and video playback, which allows web developers to easily add multimedia content to web pages without the need for additional plug-ins or external players.

Canvas: The <canvas> element in HTML5 allows developers to create dynamic graphics and animations on web pages, using JavaScript.

Web Storage: HTML5 introduces the localStorage and sessionStorage objects, which allow web developers to store data on the client-side and make web applications more responsive.

Web Workers: HTML5 allows web developers to run scripts in the background, which makes it possible to create web applications that are more responsive and performant.

Form Validation: HTML5 includes improved form validation that makes it easier to ensure that form data is entered correctly and completely before it is submitted.

Microdata: HTML5 includes microdata, which allows web developers to embed structured data in web pages to make it more easily readable by search engines.

The advantages of using HTML5 are:

Improved semantic elements: The new semantic elements in HTML5 make it easier to structure and organize the content of a web page, which improves accessibility and search engine optimization.

Multimedia support: Native support for audio and video playback in HTML5 eliminates the need for additional plug-ins or external players, which improves the user experience and reduces the risk of compatibility issues.

Offline support: HTML5 allows web applications to work offline, which makes them more responsive and reliable.

Improved performance: The new features in HTML5, such as web workers and web storage, allow web developers to create more responsive and performant web applications.

Cross-platform compatibility: HTML5 is designed to work on a wide range of devices and platforms, which makes it an ideal choice for creating web applications that need to work across different browsers and devices.


20. What are the uses of hooks concepts
Hooks are a feature in React that allow you to use state and other React features in functional components, instead of just class components. They were introduced in React 16.8 and have since become a popular way to write React components.

Here are some of the uses of Hooks concepts:

State management: Hooks make it easy to manage state in functional components, using the useState hook. This allows you to store and update component-level state without the need for a class component.

Effect management: Hooks make it easy to manage side-effects (e.g. fetching data, subscriptions, etc.) in functional components, using the useEffect hook. This allows you to declaratively specify when and how effects should run, without the need for lifecycle methods in a class component.

Context management: Hooks make it easy to consume and update context in functional components, using the useContext hook. This allows you to share state between components without the need for prop drilling.

Custom hooks: Hooks can be reused across components by creating custom hooks. This allows you to extract logic and share it across multiple components.

Code Reusability: Hooks let you extract component logic into reusable functions. It eliminates the need for HOCs and Render Props

Simplify the code: By using hooks, you can reduce the amount of code and complexity in your components, making them easier to read, understand, and maintain.

Hooks are a powerful feature that enables developers to write more functional, less complex and more readable code. They make it easier to share logic across components, manage state, and handle side-effects, and they have become an essential tool for building modern React applications.


21. What is Mobx
MobX is a library for state management in JavaScript, which can be used in React, Angular, Vue and other JavaScript frameworks. It is based on the principles of reactive programming, which makes it easy to automatically keep your components in sync with your application's state.

One of the key features of MobX is its use of a centralized store, where the application's state is stored and managed. This state is then automatically propagated to the components that need it, through a mechanism called "observing".

Another important feature of MobX is its use of "computed values", which are values that are automatically derived from the state and updated whenever the state changes. This can be used to create derived data, such as filtered lists or aggregated values, that are automatically updated whenever the underlying data changes.

MobX also has a powerful way of handling the side effects, by using the @action and @observer decorators.

In summary, MobX is a powerful library that makes it easy to manage state in JavaScript applications, by providing a centralized store, automatic change propagation, and computed values, making it easy to build complex, reactive applications with minimal boilerplate code. It is often used in conjunction with React to build web applications, due to its simplicity and powerful features.


22. What is Concurent rendering
Concurrent rendering is a feature in React that allows the component to render multiple elements at the same time, rather than waiting for one element to complete before starting the next. This feature was introduced in React 16.8, and it allows React to take advantage of the multiple cores of modern processors to improve the performance of the application.

The key to concurrent rendering is a new concept called "fiber". A fiber is a unit of work that is responsible for managing a component and its children. React's renderer is able to split a component into multiple fibers and schedule them to render concurrently.

This feature also allows React to pause, abort or reuse work, which enables React to respond to user interactions, network requests, or other asynchronous events. This means that React can start rendering a component, pause it to handle an event, and then resume rendering when the event is complete.

The main benefits of concurrent rendering are:

Improved performance by taking advantage of the multiple cores of modern processors
Reduced jank (visual stuttering) and increased frame rate while scrolling and animating
Improved user experience by allowing React to respond to user interactions, network requests, or other asynchronous events.
It's worth mentioning that while concurrent rendering can improve the performance of your application, it also comes with some trade-offs. It can make the code more complex and harder to debug, and it may require additional effort to ensure that your components are properly optimized for concurrent rendering.


23. What is Prop drilling
Prop drilling, also known as "prop passing" or "prop tunneling," is a technique in React where data or state is passed down through multiple components in the component tree, from a parent component to its children, to its grandchildren, and so on. The problem with prop drilling is that it can make your codebase harder to read and understand, and it can also make it more difficult to reuse and test components.

The main issues with prop drilling are:

Increased complexity: As the number of components in your application grows, so does the number of props that need to be passed down the component tree. This can make it harder to understand What props are being used by which components, and it can also make it harder to refactor or test individual components.

Difficulty in reusability: Passing props down multiple components can make it difficult to reuse components in other parts of the application. This is because a component that is deep in the component tree may require props from its parent, grandparent, and great-grandparent components.

Difficulty in testing: When you have deep nested components, it can be difficult to test a component in isolation because it may require props from its parent components.

To avoid prop drilling, developers can use a state management library like Redux, or the context API, which allows to share state between components without passing props down the component tree.

It's worth noting that prop drilling is not always a bad thing, it depends on the complexity of your app, and it might be the best solution in some cases. It is important to understand when prop drilling is becoming a problem and then consider using a state management library or the context API to avoid it.


24. Is it possible to use javascript in the return of react application
Yes, it is possible to use JavaScript in the return statement of a React component. In fact, this is a common practice when building React applications. The return statement of a React component is used to define the JSX (JavaScript XML) that will be rendered to the browser. However, you can also include JavaScript expressions and logic within the JSX by enclosing them in curly braces {}.

For example, you can use a JavaScript variable or a function call within the JSX by enclosing it in curly braces like this:

  Code Syntax / Example

      const name = "John";

      function App() {
        return (
          <div>
            <h1>Hello, {name}</h1>
          </div>
        );
      }

You can also use JavaScript conditionals, loops and other logic inside the JSX.

  Code Syntax / Example

      function App() {
        const isLoading = true;
        return (
          <div>
            {isLoading ? <h1>Loading...</h1> : <h1>Loaded</h1>}
          </div>
        );
      }

It's worth noting that while it is possible to use JavaScript in the return statement of a React component, it's important to keep in mind that React follows a declarative programming paradigm, so you should keep your logic minimal and simple in the JSX to avoid making your codebase hard to understand and maintain.


25. What is state, how many ways to use in react
In React, state refers to the data or variables that determine a component's behavior and render information to the user. State allows a component to keep track of internal information, such as form input values, toggle switches, and so on, and to re-render the component when the state changes.

There are two main ways to use state in React:

Class-based state: In class-based components, state is defined as a class property. It is initialized in the constructor method, and it can be modified using the setState method. The component re-renders when the state changes.

  Code Syntax / Example

      class MyComponent extends React.Component {
        constructor(props) {
          super(props);
          this.state = {
            count: 0
          };
        }

        handleClick = () => {
          this.setState({
            count: this.state.count + 1
          });
        }

        render() {
          return (
            <button onClick={this.handleClick}>{this.state.count}</button>
          );
        }
      }
      
Hooks-based state: With the introduction of hooks in React 16.8, it is possible to use state in functional components. The useState hook allows functional components to manage state. The hook takes an initial value as an argument and returns an array containing the current state and a function to update it.

  Code Syntax / Example

      import { useState } from 'react';

      function MyComponent() {
        const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

        const handleClick = () => {
          setCount(count + 1);
        }

        return (
          <button onClick={handleClick}>{count}</button>
        );
      }
      
It's worth noting that state is not always necessary, sometimes props is enough to manage the data. However, state is required when the data changes and it affects the component's behavior or rendering.

In summary, you can use state in react with class-based components or functional components with hooks, both of them have the same purpose, but the way to use it is different.


26. react.createElement()
React.createElement() is a method provided by the React library that allows you to create a React element. A React element is a lightweight, plain JavaScript object that represents a DOM node or a component. The createElement() method takes three arguments:

The type of the element (string for DOM elements or a component for custom components)
An object containing properties for the element
One or more children for the element
Here is an example of how to create a div element with a className of "container" and a child p element containing some text:

  Code Syntax / Example

      const element = React.createElement('div', { className: 'container' },
        React.createElement('p', null, 'Hello, world!')
      );

In this example, the first argument is the type of the element div, the second argument is an object containing properties { className: 'container' }, and the last argument is the child of the element React.createElement('p', null, 'Hello, world!').

It's worth noting that while React.createElement() is a low-level method and it's possible to use it to create React elements, it's less common to use it directly in a React application, since JSX, a syntax extension for JavaScript, provides a more intuitive and readable way to create React elements.

  Code Syntax / Example

      const element = <div className="container">
          <p>Hello, world!</p>
      </div>

Both of the examples above are equivalent and will create the same element.

In summary, React.createElement is a method that allows you to create a React element, it's not used very often because it's more readable to use JSX but it can be useful in some cases.


27. Write html code in javascript files
In React, it's common to use a syntax extension for JavaScript called JSX that allows you to write HTML-like syntax directly in JavaScript files. This is possible because JSX is transpiled by a tool like Babel into JavaScript code that uses React.createElement() to create the elements.

Here's an example of JSX code that creates a div element with a className of "container" and a child p element containing some text:

  Code Syntax / Example

      const element = <div className="container">
          <p>Hello, world!</p>
      </div>
This JSX code is equivalent to the following JavaScript code that uses React.createElement() to create the elements:

  Code Syntax / Example

      const element = React.createElement("div", { className: "container" },
        React.createElement("p", null, "Hello, world!")
      );

It's worth noting that you need to transpile JSX code with a tool like Babel to make it compatible with all the browsers, because JSX is not natively supported by all the browsers. Also, React is required to use JSX, the React library needs to be installed in your project to use JSX.

In summary, you can write HTML code in javascript files using JSX, it's a syntax extension that allows you to write HTML-like syntax directly in javascript files, it is transpiled by tools like Babel to React.createElement() code, it's a common practice in React development, and it is not natively supported by all the browsers, so you need to transpile it with tools like Babel.


28. What is the defference between library and framework, and why is React referred to as a library? 

The main difference between a library and a framework is the way they are used in an application.

A library is a collection of pre-written code that can be used to perform common tasks, such as making an HTTP request or parsing JSON data. A developer can choose which parts of the library to use and how to use them, and can still have full control over the application's structure and flow.

On the other hand, a framework is a set of pre-written code and conventions that dictate the structure and flow of an application. It provides a set of rules and guidelines for how to build an application, and developers have to work within those constraints.

React is often referred to as a library because it is focused on providing a way to build reusable UI components and manage the component's state. It does not dictate the overall structure of the application, and developers have full control over how they want to use React in their application. While it's not a full-fledged framework, it can be used as the view layer in a framework like React-Redux, which provides a way to manage the application's state.

In summary, a library is a set of tools that can be used in any way the developer sees fit, while a framework provides a set of rules and conventions that the developer must follow. React, as a library, allows developers to have full control over their application structure and flow, while providing a powerful toolset to build reusable UI components.

29. How to manipulate virtual dom to real dom

React manipulates the real DOM by creating and updating a virtual DOM, which is a lightweight representation of the real DOM. When a component's state or props change, React will update the virtual DOM to reflect the new changes.

Then React will compare the virtual DOM to the real DOM, and calculate the minimal number of changes that need to be made to the real DOM to match the virtual DOM. This process is known as "reconciliation".

Once the changes are calculated, React will then update the real DOM with the minimal number of changes needed, which results in a much faster and efficient update process. This is known as the "reconciliation" process.

Here's a basic breakdown of the process:

1. React creates a virtual DOM representation of the component.
2. When the component's state or props change, React updates the virtual DOM.
3. React compares the virtual DOM to the real DOM and calculates the minimal number of changes that need to be made to the real DOM.
4. React makes the necessary changes to the real DOM.

This process ensures that only the necessary changes are made to the real DOM, which can greatly improve the performance of an application. This is the reason why React is known to be fast and efficient when it comes to updating the user interface.


30. User logged in to the browser and has a search tab, the user will enter data, and that search is an overall browser search. How can you do that?

There are several ways to implement a search feature that searches the entire browser when a user is logged in. Here are a few options:

1. Open a new tab with the search results: When the user submits a search query, the application can open a new tab in the browser with the search results. This can be done using the window.open method in JavaScript.

2. Use browser search engines: You can use the window.location.assign method to redirect the user to a popular search engine such as Google or Bing and pass the search query as a parameter.

3. Use an API: You can use an API to fetch search results from a database or an external source and display them in the application.

4. Use browser extension: You can build a browser extension that can interact with the search query and open a new tab with the search results.

5. Use a service worker: You can use a service worker to intercept network requests and handle the search query, then use postMessage API to communicate with the main thread and open a new tab with the search results.

It's important to note that in order to implement search functionality, you would need to have a backend that can handle search requests and return the appropriate search results.

It also depends on the requirement of the search feature and data privacy, security, and scalability. Depending on the requirements, you can choose the appropriate method for your search feature.


31. How do we get the data without being too slow? Which hook are you using for this? 

When dealing with large amounts of data, it's important to optimize the performance of your application in order to avoid slowness and to provide a smooth user experience.

Here are a few strategies that can be used to optimize the performance when working with large amounts of data:

1. Lazy loading: Only loading the data that is currently needed, and loading more data as the user scrolls down. This can be done using libraries like react-virtualized or react-lazy-load.

2. Pagination: Splitting the data into smaller chunks and loading one chunk at a time. This can be done using libraries like react-paginate or react-js-pagination.

3. Memoization: Using the useMemo hook to prevent unnecessary re-rendering of components when the props or state don't change.

4. Filtering: Filter the data based on user input or other criteria, reducing the amount of data that needs to be displayed at once.

5. Server-side rendering: Rendering the data on the server side and sending it to the client, which can reduce the time it takes to load the data.

You can use the useEffect hook to fetch data on the client side, and useMemo/useCallback to memoize the data. Also use window.requestAnimationFrame to update the state with the new data, this will help you to avoid unnecessary re-rendering.

In general, it's a good idea to test different strategies and see which one works best for your specific use case. The key is to minimize the number of DOM updates, and to only load the data that is currently needed.
